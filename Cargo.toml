description = """
Alternative and extension to the unstable `char.encode_utf8()` and char.encode_utf16()` methods.

## Contains:
* **Utf8Char**: A `char` stored as UTF-8. Can be borrowed as a `str`.
* **Utf8Iterator**: Iterate over or read the bytes of an UTF-8 codepoint.
* **Utf16Char**: A `char` stored as UTF-16. Can be borrowed as a `u16` slice.
* **Utf8Iterator**: Iterate over the units of an UTF-16 codepoint.
* **Conversion methods on `char`**:
  * to UTF-8 as `[u8; 4]` or into `&mut[u8]`. and vice versa.
  * to UTF-16 as `(u16, Option<u16>)` or into `&mut[u16]`. and vice versa.
* **Precise errors when decoding a char from UTF-8, UTF-16 or `u32` fails.**
